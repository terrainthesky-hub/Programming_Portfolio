so I got started on a simple connectivity script using environment variables, which basically is about hiding the username and password to the Postgres DB.</p>
<p><img src="/img/env_var.JPG" alt="Connectivity"></p>
<p>After I confirmed it was working I moved on to getting the Procfile and routes working. The Procfile used gunicorn for the API and I included all the
app routes in a file called main.py. FastAPI was working so I moved on to getting the database routes made. I made a engine_connection function
to be able to sign into the Postgres db and then close the connection when it was done with the specific task. There were three tasks I made:
showing the url without the username and password, writing to the database, and reading from the database.</p>
<p><img src="/img/db_routes.JPG" alt="Database"></p>
<p>After I confirmed that this was all working properly I loaded the app to Elastic Beanstalk, an AWS application hosting tool. I made sure my
pip environment had all the necessary installations and loaded it into Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
<p><img src="/img/EB_working.JPG" alt="EB"></p>
<p>Elastic Beanstalk worked and I was able to host FastAPI and use all the functions I had made once I added the environment variables to AWS.</p>
<p>The URL retrieval worked.</p>
<p><img src="/img/get_url.JPG" alt="URL"></p>
<p>The writing to the database worked.</p>
<p><img src="/img/write.JPG" alt="Write"></p>
<p>And finally reading from the database worked as well.</p>
<p><img src="/img/read.JPG" alt="Read"></p>
<p>Everything was working properly so I deleted it from AWS because I was using AWS free tier to properly learn how to use it and I didn't want to get charged for a simple application.</p>
